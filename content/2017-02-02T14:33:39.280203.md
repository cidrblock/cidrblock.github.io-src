Summary:

### Playbook

[HERE](https://github.com/cidrblock/f5_health_check)

Clone this repo, delete the .git folder and push as a new repository to your internal or private git/github installation.

### Overview
Here is an Ansible playbook repo that collects configuration and state information from an F5, and writes these stats to individual files.

The stats are kept in a directory:

```stats/{{ inventory_hostname}}/{{ stat_name }}```

The playbook checks itself into github as well so the stats are are subject to version control.

This can be run periodically or before and after maintenance to see changes in either the configuration or running state of the bigip.

### Usage

Modify the inventory.txt file as needed.

The following environment variables need to be set and reflect your credentials:

```
export ANSIBLE_F5_USERNAME=xxxx
export ANSIBLE_F5_PASSWORD='xxxx'
export ANSIBLE_GIT_USERNAME=xxxx
export ANSIBLE_GIT_EMAIL=me@company.com
```

Run the playbook:

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt site.yml
```

When the playbook is ready to commit, the user will be prompted for their github credentials:

```
TASK [git_commit : push] *******************************************************
Username for 'https://github.company.com': me
Password for 'https://me@github.company.com':
ok: [bigip.company.com -> localhost]
```

### Example

```shell
âžœ  /working git:(master) ansible-playbook -i inventory.txt site.yml
