Summary: Ever need a nice report of all proposed changes across all network devices when running in check mode? How about an after the fact changelog per device after the run.

Ever need a nice report of all proposed changes across all network devices when running in check mode? How about an after the fact changelog per device after the run.

In group_vars/all, you'll need a new variable to store all the changes through the playbook run:

```yaml
# group_vars/all
changes: []
```

Then, as you make changes, append the changes to the change variable:

```yaml
- name: Remediate the device ({{ os }})
  ios_config:
    host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
    authorize: yes
    timeout: 60
    lines: "{{ base_config + users_remove + enable_remove }}"
  register: config_changes
  notify: "{{ os + '_save_config' }}"

- name: Append changes to log ({{ os }})
  set_fact:
    changes: "{{ changes + ['*** ROLE: ' + role_path|basename + ' ***'] + config_changes['updates'] }}"
  when: config_changes['updates'] is defined
```

Make a new role, called 'report' which can get run as the last role in the playbook:

```yaml
- name: Show config changes for device
  debug: msg="{{ changes }}"
  when: changes|length > 0
  tags:
  - report
```

Now at the end of the playbook, before the summary a nice per device report is created. The 'changes' var could also be written to a file.
