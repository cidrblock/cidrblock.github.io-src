The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

### GIT & GITHUB

This course is for developers and system administrators who want to really understand Git. Whether you just started using Git, or you've been using it every day for months - this course will give you the knowledge you need to become a Git master.

While there is nothing really shocking new to this branching model, the “big picture” figure that this post began with has turned out to be tremendously useful in our projects. It forms an elegant mental model that is easy to comprehend and allows team members to develop a shared understanding of the branching and releasing processes.

### PYTHON

Automation is the new skillset that network engineers need to pick up. Much like sysadmins have had to learn how to use new tools like Chef and Puppet, network engineers are learning that they just can't do things manually anymore.

Ok, so python is this thing called a programming language. It takes text that you’ve written (usually referred to as code), turns it into instructions for your computer, and runs those instructions. We’ll be learning how to write code to do cool and useful stuff. No longer will you be bound to use others’ programs to do things with your computer - you can make your own!

Welcome to the 3rd Edition of Learn Python the Hard Way.

[https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)

A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is important. Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within one module or function is the most important.

### ANSIBLE

What will I learn in this tutorial? You will learn how to use Ansible to configure a Linux host.

[https://www.katacoda.com/jonatanblue/scenarios/1](https://www.katacoda.com/jonatanblue/scenarios/1)

Here I'll show how easy it is to get started with Ansible. We'll start basic and then add in more features as we improve upon our configurations.

[https://serversforhackers.com/an-ansible-tutorial](https://serversforhackers.com/an-ansible-tutorial)

This course will show you how to get started with automation and orchestration using the open-source tool Ansible version 1.x. Many hands-on demos are included to show how to implement your automation tasks.

[https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/hands-on-ansible/table-of-contents](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/hands-on-ansible/table-of-contents)

Most of the time there is no need to create a custom module. However, sometimes it's the best (or even only way) to interact with a certain piece of software.

[http://blog.toast38coza.me/custom-ansible-module-hello-world/](http://blog.toast38coza.me/custom-ansible-module-hello-world/)

In this article, I will show you how to use Ansible to generate network device configurations based on a template and a variables file.

### JSON, YAML, AND MARKDOWN

JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.

[http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp)

This page provides a basic overview of correct YAML syntax, which is how Ansible playbooks (our configuration management language) are expressed.

[http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/YAMLSyntax.html](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/YAMLSyntax.html)

YAML (/ˈjæməl/, rhymes with camel) is a human-readable data serialization language.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)

Paste in your YAML and click "Go" - we'll tell you if it's valid or not, and give you a nice clean UTF-8 version of it.

If you have ten minutes, you can learn Markdown!
